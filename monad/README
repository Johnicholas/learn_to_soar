This is me trying to learn to transliterate Haskell to C++.

In particular, it's based on an example in 
Fischer, Kiselyov, and Shan's "Purely Functional Lazy Non-deterministic Programming".

It completely neglects all the call-by-need aspects of the Haskell code,
which is a substantial aspect, and it doesn't use templates at all,
though templates might be able to capture a significant fraction of what's going on in
the Haskell type system.
